ppsx - Copy file/dir name to clipboard, in SCP/RSYNC format.
Version: @VERSION@

Usage:
  $BASE
  $BASE [FILE-or-DIRECTORY]

Will copy the full path of the specified file/directory (or current directory)
and the current hostname into the clipboard, in a format compatible
with SCP/RSYNC ( user@hostname.domain:/full/path/to/file ).

Then it can be easily pasted into a command line.

Example:
  $BASE myfile.txt

  Assuming the user is 'bob', the hostname is 'foobar.cshl.edu',
  and the current directory is '/home/bob/documents/',
  the program will copy the following string into the clipboard:
     bob@foobar.cshl.edu:/home/bob/documents/myfile.txt

Note:
1. Requires 'xsel' program to be installed
2. Requires a valid X11-forwarding setting
